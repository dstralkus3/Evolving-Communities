# Core numerical and plotting libraries
numpy>=1.20.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0

# For interfacing with R code (used in inference modules)
rpy2>=3.4.0

# --- R Dependencies ---
# NOTE: These are NOT installed by pip but are required by the R environment
#       that rpy2 connects to. You need to install these in R separately, e.g.,
#       install.packages("Matrix")
#       install.packages("devtools") # If not already installed
#       devtools::install("./hbsm/hsbm_package") # Install local hsbm package
#
# - Matrix (CRAN package, usually installed with R or as dependency)
# - hsbm (The custom R package located in ./hbsm/hsbm_package/)
# - nett (Potentially needed by the hsbm R package - check its DESCRIPTION file)
